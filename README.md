# MIST_names
 @author: Shakeel Farooq
 
 Description:
 Mist_names is a program that takes names from a csv file and their friends names
 and creates a networking graph of a person and their friends.
 
 If you hover over a node it will show the attributes of a person
 and if you click on a person it will highlight them and their friends.
 
 The networking graph was orginally designed using the Bokeh library in python,
 but I switched over to d3.js because it looks nicer.
 
 The graphs can be acessed at shakeelfarooq.com (--> This is still being worked on)
