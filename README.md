 Description:
 Mist_names is a program that takes names from a csv file and their friends names
 and creates a networking graph of a person and their friends.
 
 If you hover over a node it will show the attributes of a person
 and if you click on a person it will highlight them and their friends.
 
 The networking graph is created using bokeh in python.
